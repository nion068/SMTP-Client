## SMTP Client

We have designed an SMTP client for a standard mail server using Socket Programming. We have developed a simple mail client that sends email to any recipient. The client will need to connect to a mail server, dialogue with the mail server using the SMTP protocol, and send an email message to the mail server.

Features:
1. Able to send mail (with subject) to multiple users.
2. Able to send attachment with email using SMTP.
3. Implemented with without using any JAVA high level library.
